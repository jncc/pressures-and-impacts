Sensitivity assessments following the Marine Evidence-based Sensitivity Assessment (MarESA) methodology have been undertaken for a range of biotopes. These assessments, which are available on the Marine Life Information Network (MarLIN) website, are updated by the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (MBA), using best-available evidence and peer review. Although MarESA provides sensitivity information at a detailed biotope level, for certain applications, an understanding of sensitivity is also required at a broad-scale habitat (Level 3 of the habitat classifications) and Marine Protected Area (MPA) feature-level. Sensitivity assessments for broad-scale habitats and MPA features are needed for a range of applications, including in the provision of Advice on Operations for MPA Conservation Advice, advice on marine industry casework, in offshore survey planning and in the development of marine biodiversity indicators.
