# The following document contains a series of SQL queries which enable the user to identify new Natural England (NE) 
# Activities/Pressures which are not contained within the PAD and update the PAD to account for new data. 

# 1. Query Activity data in JNCC PAD - not in NE New 

SELECT DISTINCT(ActivityTitle)

# 2. Query Activity data in NE New - not in JNCC PAD 

SELECT DISTINCT(ActivityName)
FROM Activity_Pressure_NE_New as a 
WHERE NOT EXISTS 
(SELECT * FROM Activities as b 
WHERE a.ActivityName = b.ActivityTitle
);

# 3. Query to test no. of records to be updated

AND APJ.ActivityID <> 57
AND APJ.ActivityID <> 58

AND APJ.ActivityID <> 108;


# 4. Query to update all records which fit set criteria
